# ANNDensity
ANNs for density estimation in flavour physics amplitude analyses. Code used for feasibility studies reported in https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01452

# Prerequisites

The code needs TensorFlow environment to run, together with two libraries, AmpliTF (https://github.com/apoluekt/AmpliTF) and TFA2 (https://github.com/apoluekt/TFA2). The latter includes instructions to set up the full environment in `conda`:
